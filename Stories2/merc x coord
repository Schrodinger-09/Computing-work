Naib x Martha (Merc x Coord)
" The way she causally holds up the gun , but aims and shoot with perfect accuracy... "  Martha skillfully hid behind a tree, swiftly spun around and shot down the target. 
I was sitting by the small hut , cleaning the guns before the next day's mission. But Martha's skill and power captured my attention, I sat there for one hour admiring Martha,
and only cleaned one gun!!!! I lowered my head and tried to quickly get the cleaning over and done with but everytime I heard a gunshot I lifted my head,hoping to get another 
glimpse of Martha. Although she was at the field in front of the hut, I could feel her presence lifting my head up to look at her. Her blue eyes sparkle like the sea, filled with 
passion and determination,her petite smile everytime she hit the target... mesmerising.
